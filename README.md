# Sy By Cegedim UK Technical Test

This technical test is just to give us an understanding of how you code, please create your own repo and send it to us to review when you're done.
You can write your solution in any language you want.
Don't spend more than 2 hours on the task, if you don't finish the test in the time, that's fine, we want to see what you prioritise and why.
We also want to see consistent, concise commits to your repo.

## The Scenario and Task

The scenario is that you are working on a university management system that can view the attendance and grades of various students.

The task is to create a basic application that can read in the supplied Json file "students.json" and then present the data back to us.
We want to be able to search for a student and view their information in a clear way. If you have time, also add the ability to then update their information.

## Additional functionality

This functionality isn't mandatory, so don't worry if you dont have time to look at this, but if you do you may want to add functionality 
to:
- Search for multiple students at the same time.
- Search for students in creative ways.
- Compare students to find the highest/lowest performers in various areas.
